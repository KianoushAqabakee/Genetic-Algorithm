# Genetic-Algorithm
Genetic algorithm as a Python class so you can use it as an optimization function.

# **Genetic Algorithm**
It is written in python class included these functions:
# 1.__init__:
  including parameters:
  
    1.MaxIt: maximum number of iterations
    2.nPop: number of Populations which we keep in the end of each iterations
    3.pc: CrossOver Percentage
    4.pm: Mutation Percentage
    5.gamma
    6.mu
    7.beta
    8.VarMin: minimum value of variables
    9.VarMax: maximum value of variables
# 2.RouletteWheelSelection:
  perform RouletteWheel selection method to choose parents
# 3.Crossover:
  It's a method to create childrem Chromosome from parents Chromosome.
# 4.Mutate:
  Taking a chance with other unexpected Chromosome by mutating.
# 5.GA:
  Performing all functions in an iterative processing inspired from nature
